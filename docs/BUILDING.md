# Building ThoxWarRoom

Everything needed to build, run, and verify ThoxWarRoom from source. If you only
want to *use* the app, install it from the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thoxwarroom-client/id6749840287)
or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.thox.warroom)
instead.

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flutter SDK | Recent stable, with Dart `3.9.2` or newer |
| Android | Java 17, Android SDK (compile/target SDK 36), Android 7.0+ (API 24) at runtime |
| iOS | Xcode with an iOS 16.0+ deployment target |
| macOS | macOS 14.0+, Xcode with macOS 14.0+ SDK, CocoaPods |
| Windows | Windows 10+, Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop workload, CMake 3.14+ |
| Backend | An Open WebUI instance, an OpenAI-compatible API, an Ollama endpoint, or a Hermes server |

## Clone

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ttracx/thoxwarroom.git
cd thoxwarroom
```

`--recursive` matters. ThoxWarRoom vendors three submodules:

- `third_party/mermaid`: the native Mermaid renderer packages
  (`mermaid_core`, `mermaid_flutter`), referenced by path from `pubspec.yaml`.
  Without it, `flutter pub get` fails.
- `third_party/katex`: KaTeX assets for math rendering.
- `openwebui-src`: a vendored Open WebUI checkout used **only** as an API
  reference. It is not built or shipped.

For an existing clone:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Run

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build
flutter run -d ios
# or
flutter run -d android
# or
flutter run -d macos
# or
flutter run -d windows
```

`dart run build_runner build` is not optional. Riverpod providers, Freezed
models, JSON serialization, Drift tables, and Pigeon bindings all generate into
`*.g.dart` / `*.freezed.dart` files that are **git-ignored**. A fresh clone or a
new worktree has none of them, so the analyzer will report hundreds of errors
until codegen runs. If you see missing-symbol errors that look impossible, run
codegen before you start debugging.

Use `--delete-conflicting-outputs` when generated files fall out of sync:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Verify

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

`flutter analyze` and `flutter test` are the local gates before handing work
off. GitHub Actions only runs localization validation (`.github/workflows/l10n.yml`)
and releases (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Nothing checks analyzer or test
health on every push, so run them yourself.

Tests use `flutter_test` with `package:checks` for assertions and `mocktail` for
mocks. Lints come from `flutter_lints` plus `riverpod_lint`.

## Release builds

```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release

# macOS
flutter build macos --release
./scripts/create_dmg.sh

# Windows
flutter build windows --release
./scripts/create_windows_installer.sh
```

`scripts/release.sh` drives the tagged release flow used by the maintainer.
CI builds all four platforms (Android APK+AAB, iOS IPA, macOS DMG, Windows ZIP+MSIX) on tag push.

## Localization

Translations live in `lib/l10n/*.arb`, configured by `l10n.yaml`. English
(`app_en.arb`) is the template; every other locale mirrors its keys.

Do not hand-edit the generated localization Dart. Edit the ARB inputs and let
codegen regenerate. Two helpers validate the result, and CI runs the same
checks:

```bash
dart run tool/validate_arb_locales.dart
dart run tool/verify_arb_descriptions.dart
```

Every key in `app_en.arb` needs an `@key` entry with a `description`, and that
description is the only context a translator gets.

## Project layout

## Conventions

- Diagnostics go through `DebugLogger` (`lib/core/utils/debug_logger.dart`) with
  slash-scoped `scope:` values like `auth/proxy`, `streaming/helper`, or
  `models/default`. No raw `print` calls.
- Credentials and auth tokens belong in `flutter_secure_storage` via
  `SecureCredentialStorage`. Auth-bearing headers stay scoped to Dio clients
  configured for the selected `ServerConfig.url`.
- `lib/core/services/api_service.dart` is roughly 6000 lines and mixes many
  endpoint families. Verify endpoint names against `openwebui-src/` before
  adding or changing API calls.
- Chat markdown is sanitized in `lib/features/chat/views/chat_page.dart`, but
  Chart.js blocks still render through a WebView in
  `lib/shared/widgets/markdown/markdown_config.dart`. Treat model output as
  untrusted when touching that pipeline.

## Platform permissions

**Android** requests microphone, camera, and optional location access for voice
input, image capture, and location sharing. Attachments go through the system
photo picker, so no broad storage permission is needed.

**iOS** requests microphone, speech recognition, camera, photo library, and
optional location-when-in-use access for the same workflows.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `flutter pub get` cannot resolve `mermaid_core` | Submodules are missing. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. |
| Analyzer reports errors in files you never touched | Generated code is missing. Run `dart run build_runner build`. |
| Codegen fails with output conflicts | `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` |
| iOS device build fails | `cd ios && pod install`, then confirm signing in Xcode. |
| Android build fails | Check the Java 17 / Gradle toolchain, then `flutter clean`. |
| Streaming stalls against your server | Confirm `ENABLE_WEBSOCKET_SUPPORT="true"` on the Open WebUI deployment. |
