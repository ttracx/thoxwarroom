///     sources, one query, which external-content over a single table cannot
///     express;
///  3. standalone lets us store chatId/messageId UNINDEXED so a hit maps
///     straight back to a chat row without a rowid join.

/// The duplicated content text storage cost is acceptable and bounded by the
/// same content already in `messages.content`.

/// All statements use IF NOT EXISTS and are safe to (re)run on every open.
